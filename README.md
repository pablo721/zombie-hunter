# zombie-hunter
Simple yet useful console app that downloads financial statements of listed companies, calculates interest coverage ratio (EBIT / Interest expense), finds results with interest coverage ratio &lt; 1 and ranks them by said ratio. So called 'zombie companies' are prime targets for short selling when interest rates rise.

USAGE:
just run python hunter.py us
